    <h2> Hobbies </h2>
    <p>
        I really really like playing tennis. I started playing about 4 years ago, but sadly I didn't compete in any
        competition yet.
        The one thing I particular like about tennis is the ability to play solo and in couples which are very very
        different.
        Moreover, It is more rare to get injured in a tennis match rather than in football and basketball that are more
        dangerous.
        This is me playing 2 years ago (F.Y.I I got really better since).

    <h2> Travelling </h2>
    <p>
        Another favorite hobby of mine is travelling. I really like all kinds of travel: by car, by train, by plane, and travelling on foot.
        Sadly, I have never travelled by a ship yet &#128554;.
        Usually, I prefer travelling with my friends but sometimes I prefer travelling by myself.
        The reasons I find travelling so interesting are: seeing new and beautiful sights, exploring different cultures
        and meeting lots of new people.
        My latest journey was in Georgia in August 2019. The trip was divided into 3 days in Tbilisi (Georgia's capital city) and 4 days in
        hiking the Mestia Ushguli mountains.

        <h3> Tbilisi </h3>
        <p>
            Tbilisi is very beautiful and romantic city that has a lot to offer.
            The places I liked and recommend to see are Narikala-Fortress and The Bridge of peace.
            These two places are pretty close by and near them you can find a cable that has a beautiful view to the
            whole city.
            Tbilisi is very cheap, so shopping there is really great, the Tbilisi mall is a great place for it.
            This is me in The Bridge of peace:

        <h3> Mestia Ushguli Mountains </h3>
        <p>
            There are 2 ways to get from Tbilisi to the Mestia Ushguli Mountains:
            The easy way is by a train that leaves Tbilisi two times a day: one in the afternoon and one in the night.
            The harder way is to get there by a place. I said harder since this flight from Tbilisi is pretty rare and
            you need to book it about 5 months in advance.
            This is me and few friends in our way there:

            Mestia Ushguli Mountains is the main reason I chose to visit Tbilisi.
            This place posses a very unique tracking hike that is 4 days long and is suitable also for beginners.
            As the saying goes, a picture says a thousand words so here are some photos from this lovely trek which I
            also highly recommend.
